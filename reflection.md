# Reflection

## What I Learned
I learned how GitHub repositories are structured and how issues, branches, and pull requests are used to organize a project. I also learned the importance of planning tasks before starting development.

## Challenges Faced
The most challenging part of this project was working with Git branches. I had difficulty understanding where and how to create branches, which caused confusion. Because of this problem, I was not able to properly complete the commit steps as intended.

## Future Improvements
If I had more time, I would practice using branches and commits more to better understand the workflow. I would also improve the project by adding more features and making the process more organized.
